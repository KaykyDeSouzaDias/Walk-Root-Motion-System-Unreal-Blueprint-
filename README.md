# The Project
This project is a walk root motion mechanic made with Unreal Engine blueprints, with a character that just walks through the left, right, ahead, and backward.
# Download now the final result of the project.
A playable form of the project for you to test it and enjoy it! \

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1. I calculated the rotation of the character to know where he is going. Obs.: The movement is ready because it is an Unreal project example.

2. After that, I made some variables to know when the character is moving and to make, after in animation blueprint, an animation logic.

3. I've created a blueprint interface to pick up the desired velocity.

4. Now, I've gone to the animation blueprint and there I've defined some logic for my animations because the base of root motion is the animation of the character.

   4.1- I made some logic for the desired movement to calculate the speed and direction.

   4.2- I used some variables that I've created on the character blueprint to make a stop and walk backward animation logic respectively.

5. For finish, I've picked up some animations, made blendspaces and organized on animation blueprint.
