# The Project
This project is a basic walk root motion mechanic made with Unreal Engine blueprints, with a character that walks to left, right, ahead, and backward.

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1. I downloaded a man and woman 3D model and some animations for the movement. And then, just organized everything.

2. After that, I've made a game pause system and created two variables to receive the speed and direction for the animations, and then It was just necessary to pass those variables for my animation blueprint.

3. For the finish, I just needed to create a blend space for all animations and put it inside of my animation graph to connect everything.
